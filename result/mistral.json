Let's break down the words and find the categories:  1. **Emotions**:    - GRUMPY    - HAPPY    - BASHFUL     These words are all adjectives describing emotions.  2. **File Formats**:    - PDF    - DOC    - GIF    - TIFF     These are all common file formats.  3. **Flightless Birds**:    - EMU    - OSTRICH    - PENGUIN     These are all birds that cannot fly.  4. **Fruits**:    - BANANA    - PINEAPPLE    - KIWI    - MANGO    - COCONUT     These are all types of fruits.  Now, we need to ensure each category has exactly four words. We can adjust the categories as follows:  1. **Emotions**:    - GRUMPY    - HAPPY    - BASHFUL    - ZIP (This one is a bit tricky, but zip can be associated with the phrase zip it, which can imply a feeling or action related to being quiet or reserved, similar to being bashful.)  2. **File Formats**:    - PDF    - DOC    - GIF    - TIFF  3. **Flightless Birds**:    - EMU    - OSTRICH    - PENGUIN    - KIWI (While kiwi is also a fruit, it is also the name of a flightless bird.)  4. **Fruits**:    - BANANA    - PINEAPPLE    - MANGO    - COCONUT  So, the final groupings are:  Groupings: Emotions: [GRUMPY, HAPPY, BASHFUL, ZIP] File Formats: [PDF, DOC, GIF, TIFF] Flightless Birds: [EMU, OSTRICH, PENGUIN, KIWI] Fruits: [BANANA, PINEAPPLE, MANGO, COCONUT]",

Since we need four words in each category, we can look for other words that fit a similar theme. However, no other words fit this category, so we need to adjust our approach.  4. **Words with UM Sound**:    - GLUM, PLUM    - These words contain the um sound. Again, we need four words, so we need to find two more words that fit this pattern.  Given the constraints and the need for four words in each category, let's re-evaluate and adjust the categories:  #### Final Groupings:  1. **Condiment Sauces**:    - MUSTARD, MAYO, TARTAR, KETCHUP  2. **Colors**:    - SCARLET, GREEN, PEACOCK, BLUE  3. **Streaming Services and Related Terms**:    - NETFLIX, HULU, PRIME (Amazon Prime is a streaming service), DOWN (as in downloading content)  4. **Words with UM Sound**:    - GLUM, PLUM, LOW (contains the ow sound, which is similar to um), DOWN (contains the ow sound, which is similar to um)  ### Final Answer:  Groupings: Condiment Sauces: [MUSTARD, MAYO, TARTAR, KETCHUP] Colors: [SCARLET, GREEN, PEACOCK, BLUE] Streaming Services and Related Terms: [NETFLIX, HULU, PRIME, DOWN] Words with UM Sound: [GLUM, PLUM, LOW, DOWN]",
